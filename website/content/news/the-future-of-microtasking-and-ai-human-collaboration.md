Effect AI is redefining how microtasks are completed, giving individuals the opportunity to contribute while ensuring fair pay, instant payments, and an open marketplace free from corporate control. Traditional platforms take high fees, limit access to tasks, and dictate who gets paid and when. Effect AI operates differently.

We are developing a **decentralized, open-source network** where workers, managers, and providers collaborate seamlessly. Our system allows human intelligence to supercharge AI agents, making them smarter, more accurate, and more effective. With **worker nodes, manager nodes, and provider nodes**, tasks flow through the network efficiently and securely. [**ZK-rollups](https://www.coinbase.com/en-es/learn/crypto-glossary/what-are-zero-knowledge-zk-rollups) power near-instant on-chain settlements**, eliminating payment delays, disputes, and hidden fees.

## **A Smarter Approach to Microtasking**

Most microtasking platforms are owned by a single company that controls everything. Workers have no say in how work is assigned, how much they get paid, or when they receive compensation. We have taken an entirely different approach by decentralizing the process and ensuring transparency at every level.

### **Worker Nodes: Earn Without Barriers**

Worker nodes are the **foundation of Effect AI**, allowing anyone to contribute by completing microtasks. The software runs directly in a browser and enables **peer-to-peer (P2P) communication** with manager nodes. Workers receive tasks, complete them, submit their results for validation, and claim their **on-chain payment in EFFECT tokens**. There is no corporate approval process, no third-party interference.

Other platforms make workers wait for payments, deduct hidden fees, or suddenly ban them without reason. Effect AI ensures that once a worker's submission is approved, payment is **automatically processed on-chain**.

Workers are also rewarded for simply keeping their node online. **Worker base pay** is a passive income system that provides compensation for being available to complete tasks. As long as the node remains active and passes periodic health checks, it accrues EFFECT tokens. Payouts fluctuate based on **network conditions, task volume, and worker participation**, ensuring a fair distribution of rewards.

Traditional microtasking platforms often reject work with no explanation, leaving workers unpaid. That does not happen in our network. Every submission undergoes a **validation process** before reaching the provider. Validators assess the accuracy and quality of the work, and once it is approved, payment is finalized. There are no unfair rejections.

### **Manager Nodes: A Fair System for Task Distribution**

Manager nodes keep the network organized by handling the flow of work between providers and workers. These nodes receive microtasks from providers, distribute them to available workers, track progress, request validation, and finalize payments. In traditional systems, this process is controlled by a company that can manipulate task distribution, favor certain users, or introduce inefficiencies.

Effect AI prevents these problems by decentralizing task management. **Manager nodes are run by independent operators** who must **stake a large amount of EFFECT tokens** to participate. Staking ensures that managers have a financial interest in acting fairly. If a manager engages in fraud or unfair practices, their stake can be slashed, creating built-in accountability that centralized platforms lack.

Workers assigned a task can choose to decline it, but repeated rejections may result in fewer assignments. If a submission does not meet quality standards, the task is reassigned to another worker. Consistently poor performance may lead to penalties such as reduced work opportunities or refunded payments. The entire system is **transparent, traceable, and fair**, eliminating the unpredictability of centralized microtasking platforms.

### **Provider Nodes: Faster, Smarter Microtasking Without Middlemen**

AI developers, researchers, and businesses need human input to fine-tune their AI agents. Current microtasking platforms charge high fees, limit how tasks are assigned, and introduce delays in execution. Effect AI offers a **direct, efficient** alternative that allows providers to **submit microtasks without unnecessary barriers**.

A provider creates a batch of tasks, defines its parameters, and submits them to the network. **Manager nodes distribute the work to workers**, who complete the tasks and submit results for validation. Providers no longer have to rely on a company to approve payments or wait weeks for tasks to be completed.

Prepaid funds for work are **held in an escrow account**, ensuring that payments are secure. Once a task is validated, workers and managers are **instantly paid on-chain**. Traditional platforms frequently delay payments or allow providers to reject work at the last minute. Effect AI prevents this by **locking in payments once a task is completed**.

## **A Transparent and Reliable Microtasking Network**

Effect AI guarantees that every microtask follows a **clear and fair** process. No task can be arbitrarily rejected, no payments can be withheld, and no worker is penalized without reason.

Every task moves through four distinct phases:

1. **Creation** – Providers define the task, submit it to the network, and deposit payment into escrow.
2. **Delegation** – Manager nodes assign tasks to available worker nodes.
3. **Execution** – Workers complete the task and submit their results.
4. **Settlement** – Once validated, payment is **instantly released** on-chain.

Centralized platforms often reject work without explanation, leaving workers unpaid. Effect AI eliminates that uncertainty. Once a task is approved, **it cannot be reversed or disputed**. Future iterations may introduce a structured dispute system, but the core principle remains the same. **Work gets completed, and workers get paid—no exceptions.**

## **No More Unfair Policies or Hidden Fees**

Workers on traditional microtasking platforms often face hidden penalties. Many companies **shadowban workers, reduce task visibility, or delay payments** without providing a reason. These platforms never reveal how decisions are made, leaving workers in the dark.

Effect AI ensures that **every action is recorded on-chain**, removing secrecy and unfair practices. Workers have the right to decline assignments, but repeated rejections may impact future opportunities. Consistently poor performance results in fewer assignments or reduced payouts. Unlike traditional platforms, **every rule is transparent, and every decision is trackable**.

## **Why Effect AI is the Smartest Choice for Microtasking**

Effect AI is **designed for fairness, transparency, and efficiency**. Workers and providers **control the process**, ensuring that microtasks are completed on time and payments are processed without corporate interference.

- **No hidden fees** – workers and providers keep what they earn.
- **Instant payments** – payouts are processed as soon as work is approved.
- **Fair access to tasks** – decentralized management prevents biased assignments.
- **Full transparency** – every transaction is recorded on-chain.

Effect AI is not just another microtasking platform. It is **a new standard for human-AI collaboration**. Workers get **paid fairly and immediately**, AI developers get **high-quality human input**, and **the entire process is open and decentralized**.

AI is only as smart as the data it learns from. Effect AI ensures that human intelligence plays an active role in **shaping the future of AI agents**. Workers complete microtasks that help AI systems learn, adapt, and improve. The result is a smarter, more efficient AI workforce powered by people, not corporate algorithms.
