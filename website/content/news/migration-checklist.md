## Effect AI Pre-Snapshot & Migration Checklist: Preparing for the Move to Solana

If you’re an EFX token holder or part of the Effect AI community, now is the time to get ready. Follow this step-by-step pre-migration checklist to ensure a smooth transition.

To ensure that your EFX tokens make it through the snapshot migration process, follow this comprehensive checklist. The **snapshot for token migration** will occur on **1 January at 12:00 PM UTC** for all EFX and NFX tokens, so it’s important to prepare now.


## Step 1: Prepare for the Snapshot

    The snapshot is a critical step in the migration process. Here’s what you need to do:

- **Keep Your EFX and NFX Tokens on EOS and BSC Chains:**  
Ensure your EFX/NFX tokens are stored in a wallet you control on either EOS or BSC networks.

- **Avoid Exchange Wallets:**  
Tokens held in an exchange wallet or liquidity pool during the snapshot will not be included in the migration and will be lost. Transfer your tokens to a personal wallet before the snapshot date.

- **Double-Check Your Wallet Control:**  
Make sure you have access to the private keys or recovery phrases for your wallet to retain control of your tokens.

> ⚠️ We do not recommend any trading or token movement after the snapshot date. 

## Step 2: Set Up a Wallet on Solana

    A few days after the snapshot, the new EFFECT tokens will be claimable on Solana. To prepare:

- **Choose a Solana Wallet:**  
We recommend using <a href="https://phantom.com/" target="_blank">**Phantom**</a> or <a href="https://backpack.app/" target="_blank">**Backpack**</a>, as they are user-friendly and widely supported in the Solana ecosystem.

- **Set Up and Secure Your Wallet:**  
Download your wallet from its official source, set a strong password, and back up your recovery phrase securely. Make sure you have a small amount of SOL in the wallet for the claiming transaction.

## Step 3: Wait for Official Announcements on 5 January

    After the snapshot, Effect AI will release details about the claim process. Here’s what to watch for:

- **Claim Portal:**  
The official claim portal for swapping your old EFX tokens to the new EFFECT tokens on Solana will be released by Effect AI on 5 January, 2025, on our OFFICIAL WEBSITE ONLY.

- **New EFFECT Token Contract Address:**  
The new token’s contract address will be announced via Effect AI’s official channels.

> ⚠️ Do not attempt to swap your tokens or interact with any claim portal until the official announcements are made.

Only visit the <a href="https://effect.ai" target="_blank">**Effect AI website**</a> to access the claim portal. 
 
If you encounter suspicious activity or have questions, report them to Effect AI’s support team immediately.
