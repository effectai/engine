## The Effect AI ecosystem recently made a bold move: we chose Solana as our new home, to build the next generation platform for decentralized intelligence.

As part of this transition, a new token called EFFECT will be launched, offering a straightforward 1:1 migration path for EFX token holders. This token represents a fresh start for our mission to enhance human intelligence in the AI era. In this post, we are pleased to share the first concrete details around this migration and what this means for our token holders. Please read the information below carefully and don’t hesitate to reach out via our official channels.

## Snapshots of EFX
On the 1st of January 2025, at 12PM UTC, a snapshot will be taken of all EFX and NFX token balances across EOS and BSC. This snapshot will precisely determine the EFFECT token allocation for each user on Solana. There are no additional actions required from token holders - simply ensure you hold your EFX in a wallet that you control.

After the snapshot date, EFX token will no longer be officially supported. We strongly advise against trading, purchasing, or selling EFX tokens after this point  to avoid the risk of financial loss. Users can sit back and relax while they await further instructions. 

## Claiming your EFFECT tokens
On the 5th of January 2025, we will release an official Claim Portal through our websiteofficial channels, enabling users to retrieve their new EFFECT tokens. The claim portal will remain accessible, so even holders who may have forgotten about their EFX tokens in a wallet will be able to claim their new EFFECT tokens, even years down the line. However, for tokens left on exchanges, we’re unable to assist after the snapshot is taken. This portal will be open indefinitely, so there is no time pressure to claim your tokens.
 
IMPORTANT: Remain extremely vigilant against potential scammers. Only access the Claim Portal through our official website at https://effect.ai. Do not use any other links or platforms claiming to be associated with this token migration.

## NFX holders
The Effect DAO has decided that it will discontinue support for the NFX governance toke after the snapshot date. This decision will streamline the ecosystem into a simpler, single token model. NFX holders will be able to claim additional EFFECT tokens through the Claim Portal for compensation. The exact conversion rate will be published ahead of the snapshot, and more details can be found in the following
