## Package Logic:

### Task Batch Management:
The manager node is responsible for discovering and reserving task batches (posted on-chain by provider nodes).
Task batches remain encrypted until a manager node picks them up and performs a handshake with the task provider to decrypt the batch information.

### Worker Node Discovery:
The manager package enables discovery of available worker nodes in the network. Using libp2p, the manager establishes p2p connections with workers.

### Task Delegation:
After securing a task batch, the manager node assigns individual tasks to worker nodes through a p2p connection.
Tasks are sent to workers via the /task-flow/1.0.0 protocol, and workers receive them through an interface (e.g., HTML forms) for completion.

### Task Validation:
Once tasks are completed by worker nodes, the manager node is responsible for validating the results.
After validation, the manager ensures that job results are sampled for quality and posts the validation result on-chain for transparency.

### Reward Distribution:
Upon successfully posting the results, rewards (in EFFECT tokens) are distributed to both the manager node and the worker nodes involved in task execution.

### Security & Honesty:
To ensure honesty, manager nodes are subject to slashing if they are found to be dishonest or negligent during task validation.
This slashing mechanism is overseen by the DAO, ensuring that managers act in the best interest of the network.
