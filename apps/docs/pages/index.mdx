# Effect AI Overview

Effect AI is a permissionless protocol used to supply, assign and execute human-driven AI tasks across a distributed network. Designed with versatility in mind, the protocol shines as a _human middleware layer_, integrating with **AI Agents** & **LLM Pipelines** to substantially improve the quality and reliability of their outputs.

Now that AI agents have officially entered our realm, human input is now more important than ever. In recent years the role of human input has shifted drastically, where it was first required to create training datasets and enhance digital signals produced by AI, human input is now gravitating towards 3 different verticals:

1. **Safety and Reliability**. AI agents are driven by statistical models that often struggle with uncertainty or incomplete data, which can lead to faulty decisions. Many real-world applications demand validation to ensure reliability and prevent errors. Incorporating a human-in-the-loop approach—where agents can seek clarification or confirm uncertainties—can significantly improve both
   safety and accuracy.

2. **Enhancing Outputs**. Domain experts are able to improve the output of AI models by fine tuning them on specific datasets and using specific ways of prompting.

3. **Real-World Limitations**. While AI agents are designed to operate independently and collaborate with other agents, they lack the physical presence and legal standing needed to act in the real world. They cannot own credit cards, hardware, or citizenship. Human input is crucial for bridging this gap, allowing agents to achieve physical-world goals and execute tasks beyond their inherent limitations.

## How It Works

At its core, the Effect AI Protocol is a network of three primary node types: **Provider Nodes**, **Manager Nodes**, and **Worker Nodes**. These nodes work together to supply, assign and execute human driven AI tasks.

- **Provider Nodes** are the source of tasks flowing into the network, these are tasks coming from AI agents, LLMs, or any other source that requires human input. Provider nodes are responsible for creating task batches, creating escrows on chain, and distributing them to the network.

- **Manager Nodes** reserve these batches, and start managing them, delegating each tasks to available worker nodes in the network, once the task is completed, the manager node is responsible for verifying the task accuracy and distributing rewards to the worker nodes.

- **Worker Nodes** receive tasks from manager nodes, complete them, and submit the results back to the manager nodes for validation.

## Core Use Cases

The Effect AI Protocol is designed to support a wide range of use cases, including:

- **AI Agents**: AI agents can use Effect AI to delegate tasks to people, such as data augmentations, testing, fact checking, and asking for real time data.
- **Middleware for LLMs**: The protocol can act as a middleware layer AI models, providing human-in-the-loop. Each input and output of the LLM can be validated and refined.
- **AI Pipeline**: The protocol can be implemented across various stages of an AI workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, post-processing, verifying GPT-4/LLM outputs, and evaluating vision model results.
  capabilities to improve the quality of AI outputs.
- **Content Moderation**: The protocol can be used as a content moderation tool, allowing providers to outsource moderation tasks to a distributed and diverse network of workers.
- **Data Labeling**: The protocol can be used for data labeling tasks, such as image annotation, text classification, and sentiment analysis, where AI models not yet reach the required scores.

**Many more** use cases are possible, depending on the needs of provider nodes and the capabilities of the network.
