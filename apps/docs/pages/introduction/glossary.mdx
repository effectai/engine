## Peer to Peer (P2P)

Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes.

## Nodes

Nodes are the individual entities that make up the Effect Network. There are three main types of nodes in the network: provider nodes, manager nodes, and worker nodes. Each node has a specific role and set of responsibilities that contribute to the overall functionality of the network.

## Template

A template is a blueprint for a task. It defines the task's requirements, such as the input data, the expected output, and the computational resources needed to complete the task. Templates are created by provider nodes and posted on-chain for manager nodes to use when creating tasks.

## Batches

Batches are a collection of tasks grouped together by the same template. They are created by provider nodes and posted on-chain for manager nodes to reserve and distribute to worker nodes.
