Over the past few months, we’ve been testing and improving the Effect AI platform through a series of Alpha phases, and today, we want to share what’s happened so far! These first two phases brought together a diverse group of early contributors who helped us shape the foundation of a new kind of decentralized data platform.

From validating real-world data to exploring new task flows, the Alpha proved that it’s possible to align ethical, inclusive data work with the efficiency and affordability that modern AI projects demand

## Why We’re Running the Alpha

The Alpha is our way of testing in the real world, not just the platform itself, but the workflows, reward systems, and worker experience that will define Effect AI going forward. Each phase allows us to experiment, learn, and make meaningful improvements based on direct feedback.

Our goals are simple:

- Build powerful, easy-to-use tools that simplify data validation, annotation, and a wide range of AI training workflows.

- Make rewards hassle free and accessible via $EFFECT on Solana

- Create real & impactful work opportunities for workers worldwide

- Support open, responsible, and community-led AI development

This is just the beginning, and more Alpha phases are planned as we continue to test and scale what we’ve built.

## What Happened in Phase 1 & 2

In **Phase 1**, we launched a private pilot with core community members. We focused on testing core flows like task loading, task approval, and $EFFECT claims. This first round gave us the confidence to expand.

In **Phase 2**, we onboarded more testers, introduced improvements based on early feedback, and refined the backend to handle more volume and real-time payouts. We also enhanced platform performance and began collecting more complex data types.

Some of the tasks our community completed included:

- Image verification

- Annotation validation

- Perception-based evaluation

- Sentence validation and text quality review

| **Workers Onboarded** | 20 | 35 |
| **Task Types Introduced** | 3 | 6 |
| **Datasets Verified** | 1 | 4 |

## Voices from the Community

Our testers didn’t just complete tasks, they helped build the platform with their insight and ideas. Here’s some of what they shared:

> *“I remember back in the day when we used EOS for tasks, one of the biggest headaches was always the wallet and claims process. In contrast, my experience claiming Effect on the Solana network was significantly smoother, easily 10x better.”
 — Worker 1*

> *“The user interface is generally smooth and intuitive, but I feel that some features could be streamlined.”  
 — Worker 2*

> *“I really like the new Effect worker website! Here everything works just fine and fast. Claiming payments is easy, easier then with the EOS version! The tasks are nice and I am looking forward to what is coming next!
I also like the support we get here. And all the updates and news.”
 — Worker 3*

> *“The process worked fine, even though it sometimes was lagging/ not loading tasks. But I think that's just some glitches that can easily be solved.
What I would like is some kind of log where you can see where the rewards came from; doing a task, being online, etc.**
 — Worker 4*

Feedback like this directly shaped our improvements throughout the Alpha, and reinforced the importance of building with the community, not just for it.

## What We Learned

The Alpha taught us a lot. Some of the biggest takeaways include:

- **Simple UX matters:** smoother, faster interactions help contributors stay focused and productive

- **Solana integration works:** our payment system is faster and more accessible than past versions

- **Community is everything:** real feedback made the platform better than any internal testing ever could

We also confirmed that there’s strong global interest in a platform like this, especially one that provides **real value for time spent**, and contributes to meaningful AI development.

## Up Next: Scaling the Alpha, Shaping the Future

With two Alpha phases complete, we’re now preparing for the next stage of testing, building on everything we’ve learned so far.
In the next phase, we will:

- Expand access to more contributors

- Launch additional task types to expand the range of trainable AI models

- Improve worker rewards and performance tracking

- Optimize task flows, loading speeds, and interface responsiveness to improve worker efficiency.
