            <h2>Create a sentence - Common Voice</h2>
            <p>
              In this task, you'll be writing short, simple, and natural sentences that
              follow the guidelines below. The goal is to create clear and conversational
              text that's easy to read and helps train AI models effectively.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Instructions</h3>
            <p>
              Your job is to write short, natural sentences that follow the guidelines
              below. These sentences will be used to train AI models, so it's important
              they are clear, easy to understand, and written in good English.
            </p>

            <h4>Sentence Guidelines</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Keep each sentence short ‚Äî fewer than 15 words.</li>
              <li>Write in proper grammar with correct spelling and punctuation.</li>
              <li>Use natural, conversational English that feels like everyday speech.</li>
              <li>
                Avoid slang that's hard to understand, but it's OK if the sentence feels
                casual.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each sentence should stand on its own (not depend on another sentence).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What NOT to Include</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Numbers or special characters (e.g. $, %, @, #, 123).</li>
              <li>Foreign letters or words.</li>
              <li>Overly complex or technical language that's hard to read.</li>
              <li>Personal information (like names, addresses, phone numbers, or emails).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>‚úÖ Good Sentences</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The sky is blue with light clouds.</li>
              <li>My dog likes to nap in the sun.</li>
              <li>People enjoy walking through the park.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>‚ùå Bad Sentences</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sky IS bLUE &amp; FULL OF $HINY CLOUDS!!! (wrong spelling, special characters)</li>
              <li>The country has 331,449,281 people. (numbers not allowed)</li>
              <li>The sun sets. The moon rises. (too short, not conversational)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Tips for Success</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Imagine you're writing something you would actually say out loud.</li>
              <li>Vary your topics so sentences aren't too similar.</li>
              <li>Read your sentence out loud. If it sounds awkward, rewrite it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Example Starter Topics for Sentences</h3>
