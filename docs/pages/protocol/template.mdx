# Templates

A template is a blueprint that allows you to input data and display it in a specific format. They are the interface used by the worker nodes to interact with the data and perform the tasks required by the provider node.

In this section, we will provide an overview of the template engine, explain the basic concepts and components of a template, and guide you through the process of creating your own template.

## Template Engine
The current template engine that the templates are running on are based on the [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templating engine. Handlebars is a simple templating language that allows you to build semantic templates with ease.

## Creating Your Own Template
You can try out the templates for yourself by inputting them into [EffectAI's template preview tool](https://app.effect.network/preview/).
