# Staking
Staking is a mechanism that allows token holders to lock up their tokens in order to secure the network and receive rewards. The EFFECT staking mechanism is designed to incentivize long-term participation in the network and to reward token holders for their commitment.

## Slashing
If a node breaks the rules, it can lose part of its staked tokens as a penalty. This process, called slashing, is key to keeping the network secure and discouraging bad behavior. In the EFFECT staking system, slashing is built in to protect the network’s integrity. The DAO is responsible for carrying out these penalties, ensuring everything stays fair and transparent.

## Rewards
Staking rewards are distributed to token holders who participate in the network by locking up their tokens. These rewards are designed to incentivize long-term participation and to encourage token holders to contribute to the network’s security and stability. Currently the EFFECT staking rewards are set at 10% annually, as voted on by the DAO. But this rate is subject to change based on the network’s needs and performance.
