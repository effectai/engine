# Governance
Governance is the process by which decisions are made in a decentralized network. In the Effect AI Protocol, governance is crucial for managing the network's parameters, upgrades, and other changes. Participants in the network can propose, vote, and implement changes to the protocol through a transparent and democratic process.

## Dispute Resolution
Dispute resolution is a critical aspect of governance in the Effect AI Protocol. It ensures that conflicts and discrepancies are resolved in a fair and transparent manner, maintaining the integrity of the network. Dispute resolution mechanisms are designed to handle disagreements between participants, validate task results, and ensure that rewards are distributed accurately.

## Voting
Voting is a key component of governance in the Effect AI Protocol. It allows participants to express their opinions, make decisions, and implement changes to the network. Through voting, participants can propose and vote on various proposals, including parameter changes, upgrades, and other improvements to the protocol. The voting process is transparent, secure, and decentralized, ensuring that all participants have a voice in the network's governance.
