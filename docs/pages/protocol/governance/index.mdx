# Governance
Governance is the process by which decisions are made in a decentralized network. In the Effect AI Protocol, governance is crucial for managing the network's parameters, upgrades, and other changes. Participants in the network can propose, vote, and implement changes to the protocol through a transparent and democratic process.

For 100+ cycles, The Protocol has been governed by the Effect DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that oversees the network's operations.
Currently, the DAO is migrating to solana, where it will restart its governance process.

More information on the DAO can be found [here](https://dao.effect.network).

## Proposals
A proposal is a formal request to change the protocol's parameters, upgrade the network, or implement new features. Proposals can be submitted by any participant in the network and are subject to a voting process. Proposals can be submitted through the DAO's governance portal, where they are reviewed, discussed, and voted on by the community.

for more information on how to submit a proposal, check out the [DAO website](https://dao.effect.network).

## Dispute Resolution
Dispute resolution is a critical aspect of governance in the Effect AI Protocol. It ensures that conflicts and discrepancies are resolved in a fair and transparent manner, maintaining the integrity of the network. Dispute resolution mechanisms are designed to handle disagreements between participants, validate task results, and ensure that rewards are distributed accurately.
