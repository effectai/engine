# On-Chain Settlement
The Effect AI Protocol ensures the integrity, transparency, and fairness of task execution through a robust on-chain settlement process. Leveraging cryptographic methods, the protocol validates completed tasks and distributes rewards, while keeping a focus on maintaining decentralization and efficiency.

### ZK-Rollup Integration

The protocol uses cutting-edge ZK-Rollups (Zero-Knowledge Rollups) for on-chain settlement. This allows the network to batch multiple completed tasks into a single proof, dramatically reducing the computational and storage demands on the blockchain. With zk-rollups, the network achieves:

**Scalability:** A single proof can represent the validity of thousands of tasks, reducing the need for extensive on-chain interactions.

**Security**: The cryptographic nature of zk-rollups ensures that only valid tasks are settled on-chain.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** By batching tasks, transaction fees / network congestion is minimized, making the process economically viable for all participants.

### Proof of Work Submission
Each task completed by a worker node generates a proof of work, encapsulating task completion details and validation metrics. These proofs are aggregated by the manager node, forming a single submission that is included in the zk-rollup proof. 

### On-Chain Posting and Reward Distribution
Once the zk-rollup proof is verified on-chain, a transparent, immutable record of task completion is added to the blockchain.
Rewards are then distributed from the provider node's escrow account to the participating worker and manager nodes based on their contributions. This ensures a trustless and fair reward system.

### Validation and Dispute Resolution
The use of zero-knowledge proofs and decentralized validation minimizes the likelihood of disputes. However, if discrepancies do arise, the protocol allows for dispute resolution through a decentralized arbitration process, led by the Effect DAO.
