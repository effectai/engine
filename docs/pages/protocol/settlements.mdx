# Settlement
The Effect AI Protocol is a peer-to-peer (P2P) system leveraging Solana as its settlement layer. This design ensures that all tasks are executed in a decentralized P2P manner, while settlements occur on-chain, delivering the necessary proof and transparency for payments.

## Settlement Process
After the lifecycle of a task is completed, the task provider gives the final confirmation that the batch has been completed to their satisfaction. And the manager node can initiate the settlement process. The settlement process involves the distribution of rewards to the worker nodes and the manager node based on the completion of tasks and the quality of work. The manager node does this by attaching a signature to the task results and posting them on-chain for transparency and accountability.

## Reward Distribution
The rewards are distributed to the worker nodes and the manager node based on the completion of tasks and the quality of work. The manager node is responsible for validating the work completed by worker nodes and ensuring that the tasks are done accurately and meet the quality standards set by the provider. Once the batch is validated, the manager node handles the reward distribution to both the workers and itself. The rewards are distributed based on the completion of tasks and the quality of work.

## On-chain Verification
Once the rewards are distributed, the completion record is posted on-chain for transparency and accountability. This ensures that all completed tasks are recorded on the blockchain and can be verified by all participants in the network. The on-chain verification process ensures that the rewards are distributed fairly and that the completion record is accurate and transparent.
