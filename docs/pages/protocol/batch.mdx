# Batch
Batches are a collection of tasks grouped together by the same template. They are created by provider nodes. The tasks in a batch are distributed to worker nodes by manager nodes. Once the tasks are completed, the batch is validated and the rewards are distributed to the workers and managers.

## Batch streams
Some use cases require an open-ended batch that receives tasks dynamically rather than defining them all at the outset. For example, a provider may want to transcribe live audio or process a video feed in real time. To support these scenarios, the Effect Task Network allows for batch streams, where tasks are continuously added and processed as they become available.
