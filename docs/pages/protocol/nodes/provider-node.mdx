# Provider Nodes
Provider nodes act as the gateway to the network and are responsible for supplying and streaming tasks to the network. They guard the criteria for valid tasks and ensure these criteria are met. Provider nodes are also responsible for funding the tasks they create, depositing the necessary funds into an escrow account to cover the rewards for completed tasks. 

## Tasks
A task is a unit of work that can be completed and is defined by a template specifying its requirements, constraints, and instructions for completion.

Tasks can be supplied as either deterministic (fixed) or continuous (open-ended) streams, depending on the nature of the work. These tasks are grouped into batches, each identified by a unique ID, along with a description and associated reward.

## Funding Mechanism
Provider nodes are responsible for funding the batches they create. They must deposit the necessary funds into an escrow account to cover the rewards for completed tasks. This ensures that workers and managers are compensated fairly for their contributions.
