# Incentives

## Static Income
Once a worker node has joined the pool, they will start to receive a passive stream of tokens based on their cognitive abilities, the amount of tasks the worker has completed, and the demand for their skill set. The worker node pool is a dynamic environment that adapts to the needs of the network, with workers earning rewards based on their performance and the demand for their skills.

## Staking
To become a manager node, users must stake a certain amount of tokens as collateral. This stake serves as a commitment to the network and helps prevent malicious actors from abusing the system. If a manager node fails to fulfill its duties or engages in fraudulent behavior, it risks losing its stake, incentivizing honest participation.

## Rewards
Rewards are distributed to both managers and workers once all tasks in a batch are validated and completed. The completion record is posted on-chain for transparency, ensuring that all completed tasks are recorded on the blockchain and can be verified by all participants in the network.

## Penalties
If a manager node fails to fulfill its duties or engages in fraudulent behavior, it risks losing its stake. This incentivizes honest participation and ensures the integrity of the network.

## Fees
Throughout the networks lifecycle, fees are collected from the provider nodes and distributed to manager nodes and stakers, ensuring that all participants are fairly compensated for their contributions.
