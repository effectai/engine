## Static Income
Once a worker node has joined the pool, they will start to receive a passive stream of tokens based on their cognitive abilities, the amount of tasks the worker has completed, and the demand for their skill set. The worker node pool is a dynamic environment that adapts to the needs of the network, with workers earning rewards based on their performance and the demand for their skills.
