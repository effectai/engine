# Key concepts
In this section, we will provide an overview of the key concepts of the Effect AI protocol, explain the basic components and interactions of the protocol, and guide you through the process of understanding the core concepts of the protocol.

## Protocol Overview
The Effect AI protocol is a decentralized system that uses blockchain and peer-to-peer (p2p) technology to connect three main entities: worker nodes, manager nodes, and provider nodes. These components collaborate to assign, complete, and verify AI-driven tasks within the network. The data lifecycle of the network consists of four main stages: batch creation, task delegation, task validation, and result posting. Each stage plays a crucial role in the overall functionality of the network and ensures that tasks are managed and completed in a decentralized and efficient manner.

## Worker Nodes
Worker nodes are the backbone of the Effect Tasks network, responsible for completing tasks assigned to them by manager nodes. These worker nodes can be individuals seeking to earn rewards by completing AI-driven tasks. Worker nodes use their computational resources to complete tasks and submit the results back to the manager nodes for validation.

### Completing Tasks
Worker nodes complete tasks by following the instructions provided in the task template. They input the required data, perform the necessary computations, and submit the results back to the manager nodes for validation. Worker nodes are rewarded for their work based on the completion of their tasks and the quality of their work.

### Task Validation
Once worker nodes complete tasks, the manager nodes validate the results to ensure that the tasks have been completed accurately and meet the specified requirements. If the manager nodes are satisfied with the results, they approve the tasks, and the worker nodes are rewarded for their work. If the manager nodes are not satisfied, a dispute resolution process may be initiated to resolve any issues.


## Manager Nodes
Manager nodes are responsible for delegating tasks to worker nodes, validating completed tasks, and distributing rewards to both workers and themselves. These manager nodes play a crucial role in the data lifecycle of the network and ensure that tasks are assigned, completed, and verified in a decentralized and efficient manner.

### Task Delegation
Manager nodes use a peer-to-peer (p2p) connection to assign individual tasks to available worker nodes in the network. They manage the distribution of tasks, ensuring that workers are provided with the right jobs based on their skills, availability, and demand. Manager nodes also ensure that tasks are completed accurately and meet the specified requirements.

### Task Validation
Manager nodes are responsible for validating completed tasks to ensure that the tasks have been completed accurately and meet the specified requirements. Depending on the required validation rate of the batch, manager nodes may need to (re)delegate the completed tasks to other worker nodes for validation. This process ensures that tasks are verified and approved before rewards are distributed.

### Reward Distribution
Once tasks are validated, manager nodes handle the reward distribution to both the workers and themselves. They access the escrow account created during batch creation to distribute the rewards to the workers based on the completion of their tasks and the quality of their work. This process ensures that workers are rewarded for their efforts and incentivized to continue completing tasks on the network.

## Provider Nodes
Provider nodes are the vital source of job collections (batches) within the Effect Tasks network, responsible for posting tasks that need to be completed. These providers can be individuals, organizations, or developers seeking to leverage the decentralized workforce for various projects, ranging from transcribing audio files to document translation tasks to verification in AI-generated content.
