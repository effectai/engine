# Core concepts
In this section, weâ€™ll introduce the core concepts of the Effect AI protocol, break down its key components and interactions, and provide a clear guide to help you understand its foundational principles.

## Protocol Overview
The Effect AI protocol is a decentralized system that uses blockchain and peer-to-peer (p2p) technology to connect three main entities: worker nodes, manager nodes, and provider nodes. These components collaborate to assign, complete, and verify AI-driven tasks within the network. The data lifecycle of the network consists of four main stages: task creation, task delegation, task validation, and task result posting. After tasks in the network are completed, the protocol settles on chain for verification and reward distribution.

## Entities
The Effect AI protocol consists of three main entities: worker nodes, manager nodes, and provider nodes. Each entity has a specific role and responsibility within the network.


#### Worker Nodes
Worker nodes are individual participants in the network who complete tasks assigned to them by manager nodes. They use their skills and expertise to complete tasks accurately and efficiently. Worker nodes are rewarded for their work based on the completion of tasks and the quality of their work. They play a crucial role in the completion of tasks and contribute to the overall functionality of the network.

#### Manager Nodes
Manager nodes are responsible for delegating tasks to worker nodes, managing the distribution of tasks, and ensuring that tasks are completed accurately and efficiently. They use a peer-to-peer (p2p) connection to assign individual tasks to available worker nodes in the network. Manager nodes play a crucial role in the coordination and management of tasks within the network and contribute to the overall efficiency of the network.

#### Provider Nodes
Provider nodes are entities that create tasks and define the requirements for the tasks they want to create. They submit a batch of tasks to the network, which is then broadcasted to manager nodes for reservation. Provider nodes play a crucial role in the creation and definition of tasks within the network and contribute to the overall functionality of the network.

### Data lifecycle
The data lifecycle of the Effect AI protocol consists of four main stages: batch creation, task delegation, task validation, and result posting. Each stage plays a crucial role in the overall functionality of the network and ensures that tasks are managed and completed in a decentralized and efficient manner. The data lifecycle of the network is as follows:
- **Batch Creation**: The first stage in the data lifecycle of the network. Provider nodes define a template for the tasks they want to create, submit the batch of tasks to the network, and create an escrow account holding the necessary funds.
- **Task Delegation**: The second stage in the data lifecycle. Manager nodes decrypt the task details and start delegating tasks to worker nodes using a peer-to-peer (p2p) connection.
- **Task Validation**: The third stage in the lifecycle of a batch. Manager nodes are responsible for achieving the required validation rate on the batch by delegating completed tasks to other worker nodes for validation.
- **Result Posting**: The final stage in the data lifecycle. Once all tasks in a batch are validated, rewards are distributed to both managers and workers, and the completion record is posted on-chain for transparency.
