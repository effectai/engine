# Task Lifecycle
The Effect Task Network is a decentralized system that uses blockchain and peer-to-peer (p2p) technology to connect three main entities: worker nodes, manager nodes, and provider nodes. These components collaborate to assign, complete, and verify AI-driven tasks within the network. The data lifecycle of the network consists of four main stages: batch creation, task delegation, task validation, and result posting. Each stage plays a crucial role in the overall functionality of the network and ensures that tasks are managed and completed in a decentralized and efficient manner.
