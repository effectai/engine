## Worker Nodes
Worker nodes are essential to the functionality of the Effect Tasks network, serving as the execution layer for tasks. They peform the heavy lifting by actively processing and completing tasks that range from data labeling, to audio transcribing, to verifying AI generated content. Each task must be completed within the framework set by the task provider, with manager nodes overseeing the entire process to ensure quality and accuracy. Once a task is submitted by a worker, the manager node validates the work. After validation, the worker node is rewarded based on their contribution.
