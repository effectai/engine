# Entities and Roles

In the Effect Network, there are three main entities that play a crucial role in the network's operation: Task Providers, Manager Nodes, and Worker Nodes. Each entity has a specific role and set of responsibilities that contribute to the overall functionality of the network. By understanding the roles of each entity, we can better appreciate how the Effect Network operates and how tasks are managed and completed in a decentralized and efficient manner.
