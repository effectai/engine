# Batch Lifecycle

This page describes the lifecycle of a batch in the network.
A batch is a collection of tasks that are posted by a task provider and managed by a manager node.
The lifecycle of a batch includes the following stages:

1. **Creation**: A task provider creates a batch of tasks and posts it on-chain.
2. **Reservation**: A manager node reserves the batch and decrypts the job details.
3. **Delegation**: The manager node assigns tasks to worker nodes based on their skills and availability.
4. **Validation**: The manager node validates the completed tasks and rewards the worker nodes.
5. **Verification**: The completed tasks are verified and posted on-chain for transparency.
