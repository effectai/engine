# Our Mission
Effect AI's mission is to revolutionize the way AI solutions are developed, deployed, and verified by providing a secure, decentralized network that connects human workers with AI developers. Our platform enables users to launch, leverage, and verify human-powered AI solutions in a transparent and efficient manner.

We think power should be distributed, not centralized. That's why we've built a platform that empowers individuals and organizations to access a global workforce of skilled workers, while ensuring that tasks are completed accurately and fairly. By leveraging blockchain technology and peer-to-peer (p2p) connections, we're able to create a decentralized ecosystem that benefits everyone involved.
