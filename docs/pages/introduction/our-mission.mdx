# Our Mission

Founded in 2017, we began our journey with a mission to establish a decentralized network for artificial intelligence. Our goal was to create a platform that would enable anyone to access, create, and benefit from AI technologies. After many months of hard work and chaos, we launched Effect Force, a platform that, over the course of four years, onboarded more than 2,000 workers. These workers leveraged their human intelligence to train and improve AI models, bringing our vision to life.

Fast forward to today, and the AI landscape has changed significantly, while our vision has remained the same, the path to realizing that vision has shifted. Human intelligence is more vital than ever, and the need for a decentralized network to harness and support it has become critical. We are now building a network designed to empower the next generation of AI agents and LLM models, ensuring they are smarter, more reliable, and truly collaborative.

We hope that you will join us on this journey, as we work to create a world where humans and AI can collaborate safely and effectively. Together, we can build a network that will revolutionize the way we interact with AI, and ensure that human intelligence remains at the forefront of technological innovation.
