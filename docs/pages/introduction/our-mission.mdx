# Our Mission

Founded in 2017, we began our journey with a mission to establish a decentralized network for artificial intelligence. Our goal was to create a platform that would enable anyone to access, create, and benefit from AI technologies. We envisioned a world where AI was not just the domain of large corporations and research institutions but was accessible to all, empowering individuals and organizations to harness the power of AI for their own needs.

Fast forward to today, and we have made significant progress towards realizing that vision. But our mission is far from complete. Even now, organizations are still trying to keep AI technologies locked behind closed doors, and the race for access to pure human data is becoming increasingly competitive.

That's why we're building a decentralized network to make human intelligence accessible to everyone. Our goal is to open up AI to individuals and organizations alike, creating opportunities for all to contribute to and benefit from its potential. By doing this, we aim to foster a fairer and more inclusive future.

Thank you for being a part of our journey. Together, we can build a better future for all.
