# Effect AI

## Project Overview
The Effect Task Network is a decentralized system that uses **blockchain** and **peer-to-peer (p2p) technology** to connect three main entities: **worker nodes**, **manager nodes**, and **task providers**. These components collaborate to assign, complete, and verify AI-driven tasks within the network.

Here’s how it works:

- **Task Providers** start by posting job collections (called batches) on-chain. These batches can include tasks like data labeling, transcription, or other AI-driven work.
- **Manager Nodes** then distribute these tasks to **Worker Nodes** using a p2p connection. Worker nodes complete tasks via an interface, like a web form, and submit them back for validation.
- **Manager Nodes** check and confirm the work, ensuring accuracy. Once tasks are validated, rewards are distributed to both managers and workers, and the completion record is posted on-chain for transparency.


## Core Use Cases

The Effect Task Network is designed to support a wide range of use cases, including:

- **Data Labeling**: Workers can label data for machine learning models, such as identifying objects in images or transcribing audio files.
- **Transcription Services**: Workers can transcribe audio files, videos, or other media content.
- **Verification Tasks**: Workers can verify the accuracy of AI-generated content or other tasks that require human judgment.
- **Content Moderation**: Workers can moderate user-generated content, such as identifying inappropriate or harmful material.
- **Translation Services**: Workers can translate text or audio content between languages.
- Many more use cases are possible, depending on the needs of task providers and the capabilities of the network.
