# Effect AI Protocol

## Protocol Overview
Effect AI is a decentralized protocol to supply, assign, and execute human-driven AI tasks efficiently across a distributed network.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **Provider Nodes** broadcast a series of tasks to the network. These batches can include tasks like data labeling, transcription, or any other AI-driven work, along with instructions on how to complete these tasks.

- **Manager Nodes** receive these batches, and start managing them, delegating each tasks to available worker nodes in the network, once the task is completed, the manager node is responsible for verifying the task accuracy and distributing rewards to the worker nodes.

- **Worker Nodes** receive tasks from manager nodes, complete them, and submit the results back to the manager nodes for validation. 

## Core Use Cases

The Effect AI Protocol is designed to support a wide range of use cases, including:

- **AI Pipeline**: The protocol can be implemented across various stages of an AI workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, post-processing, verifying GPT-4 outputs, and evaluating vision model results.
- **Data Labeling**: Workers can label data for machine learning models, such as identifying objects in images or transcribing audio files.
- **Transcription Services**: Workers can transcribe audio files, videos, or other media content.
- **Verification Tasks**: Workers can verify the accuracy of AI-generated content or other tasks that require human judgment.
- **Content Moderation**: Workers can moderate user-generated content, such as identifying inappropriate or harmful material.
- **Translation Services**: Workers can translate text or audio content between languages.

**Many more** use cases are possible, depending on the needs of provider nodes and the capabilities of the network.
