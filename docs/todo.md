the current flow is as follows: 

The sequence has 4 main systems/actors: worker nodes, manager nodes, task providers, and the blockchain.
The flow starts with a task provider posting a batch to the blockchain, a batch is just a set of instructions on how to complete a series of tasks, along with a possible template, and data.

a manager node then fetches the blockchain for batches to manage, and reserves a batch that they want to manage.
then a handshake is peformed between the task provider and manager, decrypting the data, at this point a task provider can also not make the handshake (denying the manager of work)
